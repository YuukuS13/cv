    <h3>About Me</h3>

    <p>
    Hi, thanks for visiting my personal page. As you know, my name is John, and I am a 12 year US Army veteran with over 4 years<br>
    in the IT industry. I am happily married to my bride of 9 years and we have the magnificent blessing of raising our three children.<br>
    Additionally, I enjoy learning about reformed theology, classic Japanese sports cars, fitness, and most recently, learning how to code.
    </p>

    <p>
    I've been in my most current position, as a Major Incident Manager for Microsoft, since September 2018. I work for them through a <br>
    vendor, Mindtree Limited, where I also served as a Sr. Support Engineer on the Microsoft Azure IaaS Platforms team, where I had the<br>
    privilege of serving Microsoft's Premiere customers globally. In this role, I've had over a 97% customer satisfaction rating and provided<br>
    over 150 tutorials in just over a years timespan. During this time, I was able to sharpen my skills using the Linux OS systems within the <br>
    Azure environment.
    </p>

    <p>
    Prior to working at Microsoft, I was a Jr. Systems Administrator for a beverage distribution company, Olympic Eagle. This was my <br>
    first job in the IT industry and I first served here as an intern before eventually being hired (I received the highest ratings on my<br>
    review, btw). In this position, I was responsible for the saving the company over $350k worth of repairs due to my background in electronics<br> 
    with the US Army. Other responsibilites and projects were upgrading the network infrastructure from 1 gigabit to 10 gigabit cabling, improving<br>
    the wifi (WLAN) infrastructure, and managing the Cisco Meraki Mobile Device Management (MDM) system, which consisted of over 600 end user<br>
    devices, utilizing Android, Apple iOS, and Microsoft operating systems.
